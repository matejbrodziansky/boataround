the string we want to encode
the shift of the cipher
create decode function which takes two arguments:
the encoded string we want to decode
the shift of the original cipher

Data scraping
Get average price of the sailing yacht in Zadar, that are available from 4. June 2022 to 11. June 2022 with review score 7+
BONUS: add some more statistics about those boats (average age, min price, and even more, its up to you)

Sum of primes

create a function to find the number of possible decompositions of the given whole number to the primes
function needs to accept integer as input value
function should return integer value
N		S(N)
4=	2+2	1
5=	2+3	1
6=	2+2+2 = 3+3	2
7=	2+2+3 = 2+5	2
8=	2+2+2+2 = 2+3+3 = 3+5	3
9=	2+2+2+3 = 2+2+5 = 2+7 = 3+3+3	4
10=	2+2+2+2+2 = 2+2+3+3 = 2+3+5 = 3+7 = 5+5	5
##Bonus

Create unit tests

##Delivery

( Create git repository (github, bitbucket...) with your code OR pack your code to .zip ) AND send link or file to pavel@boataround.com and to miroslav.kostka@dev.boataround.com

##Last words
